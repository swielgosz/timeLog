we work on astro and ML. we are looking at trajectory design, and in particular these useful orbits

don't say: neural odes are better at learning smoother represenations of the dynamics. we're gonna make it more nearly linear 
don't say the proof of concept is useful
cushion myself - these are preliminary results. we want to prove that we can reproduce these results before going to more interesting systems in latent dynamics. stepping stone in utility
