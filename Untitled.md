to prevent stiffness:
dd regularization so the model must learn smooth dynamics:

  

**Options:**

- Jacobian norm penalty
    
- Spectral norm on layers
    
- Lipschitz activations
    
- Penalize solver steps (soft constraint)

evaluate with a fixed step Evaluate with:

- fixed-step RK4

Add one or more:

- Jacobian norm penalty
    
- Lipschitz / spectral norm constraint
    
- Penalize high curvature
    
- Penalize solver step count
