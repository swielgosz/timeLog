Finalizing parallelization of weights and biases sweep. I was having some trouble with saving visualizations to wandb as artifacts because 

Attended group meeting for X-Lab. John presented about his hybrid electric rotorcraft project. His goal is to find the point at which hybrid vehicles become more efficient than electric only vehicles, which is a functions of required battery size and travel range. Other work has looked at hybrid electric rotorcraft, but John's novelty is that he will be able to vary the power share ratio between battery and engine power sources to optimize the rotorcraft. Goal is to support VTOL efforts long term.

Helped X-Lab labmates with some python and git related questions for their RL project. Goal of their project is to develop a method to verify the safety of blackbox RL controllers. For example, airplane control could hypothetically be done with blackbox controller but FAA would never approve that without vigorous safety regulations. How do we perform these regulations? As a proof of concept, they are using StableRetro Mario Kart simulator to first train an agent with an appropriate reward structure. This is step 0 to then work on the formal methods/mathematical formulation to try to verify the agent's safety. They haven't gotten that far yet though, not sure what it will look like.

Forgot to record today, sorry :(

Working on fixing heat map visualizations and beginning other visualizations. Attended a graduation which ate up some of the afternoon - going to make up some time over the weekend.

Bad day. Brain was doing a lot of this ![[Pasted image 20250506094055.png|100]]. This was weird because normally Mondays are productive days for me with a fresh start to the week, meetings to prep for, etc. 

What was different today than other days? Didn't get good sleep the night before which I normally do. I also started apartment hunting over the weekend which is partially fun/exciting, partially just exacerbates/makes me think even more of current economic conditions which has been what one might call... a bummer. I try my best to ignore current events while I am working, but it's more difficult to do this some days than others, and this was one of those days.

But anyway, I was thinking about how why my Mondays are typically productive, and why my time management and general level of achievement used to be better in undergrad. Aside from external issues like long covid or whatever is happening, I think I did better when I had a busier schedule. Changes in scenery were also good due to taking classes, which could translate to going on walks more often during the day to let thoughts marinate and stretch my legs. I know I'm capable of doing way more than I have been, and I think
