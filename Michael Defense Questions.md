how do you calculate the time to go
did you use cartesian for rtansfer and rendevous or just rendesvous
pre generated mass optimal tractories go in experience replay buffer
why is bang bang optimal
56 - why is it stochastic?
you mentioned position residual in transfer - is there a measure of velocity res? nvm he mentions it
slide 70 - how would you change your reward function? higher terminal reward?
