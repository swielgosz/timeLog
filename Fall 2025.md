## Recap
I am preparing for my literature review about numerical techniques to discover periodic orbits in the CR3BP. I originally began my introduction of shooting methods with a simple example akin to the classic cannon problem, but as I've gone on I don't think that it's worth including this with the time that I have.

I collected many resources regarding PO discovery in the CR3BP (primarily papers, theses, repos from Kathleen Howell's group) but I realized my recollection of the fundamentals of stability analysis was shaky and the resources that I was referencing were a step beyond where my understanding was at.

To this end, I am working through Shane Ross's [CR3BP course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAXDF9vWi7PuE2ZQQ2hXyYt_), which provides a good primer on the content and introduces numerical differentiation methods for orbit discovery. I brushed up on some fundamental concepts from linear algebra/numerical methods/astrodynamics, most notably in the area of stability analysis. Now, I'm ready to take a deeper dive into the actual implementation side of numerical differential correction. This will involve:
- STM
- Single Shooting
- Multiple Shooting
- Collocation

## Goals for the day
At a high level, I want to cement my understanding of differential correction, with a focus on single and multiple shooting methods today, and collocation tomorrow. I want to end the day with an better understanding of collocation and the monodromy matrix, but not necessarily do anything with this yet.
- [ ] Refer to Grebow's thesis and https://bluescarni.github.io/heyoka.py/notebooks/Periodic%20orbits%20in%20the%20CR3BP.html for numerical methods guidance
- [ ] Before coding, outline the steps required in detail
- [ ] At a minimum, Lyapunov orbit discovery
- [ ] Preferably halo or some type of 3D orbit discovery as well
