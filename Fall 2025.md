## 3D training
Last week, I began training on 3D orbits (as opposed to the planar ones we used for the conference). The segment length is 10, i.e. the trajectory is split into 36 segments before training. The loss curves are converging to acceptable values:

I did a sanity chck by testing on a random orbit that fell within the bounds of the training data and got very bad results:

During group meeting, Kruti asked if I had tried differ initial conditions. I had tried altering the shape of the orbit and got similarly bad results, but I had not altered the initial true anomaly.  When I change nu0 from 0 to 20 degrees, I get much better results:

What does this indicate? When we generate data, we take a random initial true anomaly from 0 to 360 degrees. The other orbital elements are randomized according to our desired dataset. When we load the data in, we segment the trajectory. Because of this segmentation, I am surprised that the initial true anomaly would have such a large impact since the model is functionally exposed to *many* different initial true anomalies
