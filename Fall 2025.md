## 3D training
Last week, I began training on 3D orbits (as opposed to the planar ones we used for the conference). The loss curves are converging to acceptable values:

I did a sanity chck by testing on a random orbit that fell within the bounds of the training data and got very bad results:

During group meeting, Kruti asked if I had tried differ initial conditions. I had tried altering the shape of the orbit and got similarly bad results, but I had not altered the initial true anomaly.  When I change nu0 from 0 to 20 degrees, I get much better results:

What does this indicate?
