## Recap
I am preparing for my literature review about numerical techniques to discover periodic orbits in the CR3BP. I originally began my introduction of shooting methods with a simple example akin to the classic cannon problem, but as I've gone on I don't think that it's worth including this with the time that I have.

I collected many resources regarding PO discovery in the CR3BP (primarily papers, theses, repos from Kathleen Howell's group) but I realized my recollection of the fundamentals of stability analysis was shaky and the resources that I was referencing were a step beyond where my understanding was at.

To this end, I am working through Shane Ross's [CR3BP course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAXDF9vWi7PuE2ZQQ2hXyYt_), which provides a good primer on the content and introduces numerical differentiation methods for orbit discovery. I brushed up on some fundamental concepts from linear algebra/numerical methods/astrodynamics, most notably in the area of stability analysis. Now, I'm ready to take a deeper dive into the actual implementation side of numerical differential correction. This will involve:
- STM
- Single Shooting
- Multiple Shooting
- Collocation
