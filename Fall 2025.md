# September 9

## Recap
I am currently working on understanding how QPOs are generated for my lit review/deepening of understanding of dynamics models. To guide my understanding, I am dissecting the [CR3BP repo](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research) that I previously used to generate training data for my neural ODEs.

Relevant terms to learn and/or implement:
- Shooting methods
	- Single shooting methods
	- Multiple shooting methods
- Differential correction
	- STMs needed for anything involving sensitivities, corrections, or stability
- Continuation methods
- Constraints
- Crossing events

I also need to finalize a research topic for the semester. I am generally interested in looking at n-body dynamics and exploiting the latent nature of neural ODEs. What can we improve using this?

## Goals
- [ ]  Study and understand all the terms above at a medium level
- [ ]  Fully understand and implement shooting methods for a simple example
- [x]  Finalize semester research topic - what are we doing that is novel? How can we exploit the latent nature of neural ODEs? What system will we study? What methods are currently used?
- [ ] Improve understanding of adjoint method - I need to know this in my sleep

## Future plans - neural ODEs for nBP
Latent space representation - a latent space is an embedding of a A latent space, also known as a latent feature space or embedding space, is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of a set of items within a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") in which items resembling each other are positioned closer to one another. Position within the latent space can be viewed as being defined by a set of [latent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable "Latent variable") that emerge from the resemblances from the objects.

In most cases, the [dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality "Dimensionality") of the latent space is chosen to be lower than the dimensionality of the [feature space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_space "Feature space") from which the data points are drawn, making the construction of a latent space an example of [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction "Dimensionality reduction"), which can also be viewed as a form of [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space#cite_note-1)

Ideas:
- Encode trajectories in latent space to reveal stable/unstable manifolds for trajectory design in latent coordinates. Use to search for heteroclinic connections, design initial guesses for transfers
- Multi-fidelity residual modeling - with NBP dynamics as our baseline, let a latent ODE parameterize residuals (unmodeled forces like SRP, outgassing, drag)
- Fast surrogate propagation across regimes - encode initial pconditions to z0 svolve \dot{z}
	- Use for Monte Carlo, reachability analysis, coverage, design loops
	- Benchmark - test speedup vs high-fidelity integrator
	- Latent dynamics much simpler than raw n-body dynamics, so we get quicker propagation for Monte Carlo, optimization, design tasks
	- Use cases:
		- Trajectory Design and exploration - once trained, latent ODE can generate trajectories in milliseconds letting us sweep wide design spaces. Example - explore families of NRHOs 
		- Reachability and coverage studies cheaply
		- No: Flight computers are resource-constrained — they can’t run ephemeris-driven N-body propagation in real time.

## Summary
Today I continued research for literature review regarding periodic orbit discovery. Technical notes for relevant topics are found in Technical Notes/Periodic Orbit Discovery. I began implementing shooting methods in a Jupyter notebook. I will first present a simple problem where we only need to use root-finding methods, then advance to the more complex Kepler's problem and CR3BP where STMs are required. 

In my 1:1, John and I agreed on a research idea which will require more fine tuning, but at a high level we want to design neural ODEs to point us to POs or QPOs in complex environments (CR3BP -> 3BP -> 4BP).  We are hoping these become observable in latent space. We are beginning
