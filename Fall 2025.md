## Recap
Last week, I gave a literature review about periodic orbit discovery. I didn't get to multiple shooting methods or collocation, but will need to implement these in my own work. I want to go back and add these methods to the colab I shared out. I have a few other updates to make that I noted within the colab to work through.

Ultimately, I want to have a dynamics repo hopefully eventually extending to PO and QPO discovery in CR3BP, 3BP, 4BP (maybe include other trajectories?). I have a general outline of what I want this to look like, but John and I are going to discuss this further today.

As I continue to work on this, I also need to finalize my schedule and ultimate goal for the semester. We have an idea of where to go but not how to do it.

As a jumping off point, John recommended "Spacecraft Relative Motion Dynamics and Control Using Fundamental Modal Solution Constants" and "Geometric perspectives on fundamental solutions in the linearized satellite relative motion problem" from HP Schaub's group. I started working through those yesterday as well as some of my remaining Shane Ross videos. I want to review these in more depth today to be able to identify if/where they will be useful for us.

## Goals
- [ ]  Second pass through papers by HP Schaub
	- [ ] Be able to explain them and identify if/where they will relate to our problem
- [ ] Solidify goal for the semester in words
	- [ ] I have notes on my plan, but I should summarize them into a more concrete problem statement and identify areas that will require the mose research/effort
	- [ ] Similarly, we started a semester schedule but I still need to fill in some details and dates

## Recap
I am preparing for my literature review about numerical techniques to discover periodic orbits in the CR3BP. I originally began my introduction of shooting methods with a simple example akin to the classic cannon problem, but as I've gone on I don't think that it's worth including this with the time that I have.

I collected many resources regarding PO discovery in the CR3BP (primarily papers, theses, repos from Kathleen Howell's group) but I realized my recollection of the fundamentals of stability analysis was shaky and the resources that I was referencing were a step beyond where my understanding was at.

To this end, I am working through Shane Ross's [CR3BP course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeHTafWecAXDF9vWi7PuE2ZQQ2hXyYt_), which provides a good primer on the content and introduces numerical differentiation methods for orbit discovery. I brushed up on some fundamental concepts from linear algebra/numerical methods/astrodynamics, most notably in the area of stability analysis. Now, I'm ready to take a deeper dive into the actual implementation side of numerical differential correction. This will involve:
- STM
- Single Shooting
- Multiple Shooting
- Collocation

## Goals for the day
At a high level, I want to cement my understanding of differential correction, with a focus on single and multiple shooting methods today, and collocation tomorrow. I want to end the day with an better understanding of collocation and the monodromy matrix, but not necessarily do anything with this yet.
- [ ] Refer to Grebow's thesis and https://bluescarni.github.io/heyoka.py/notebooks/Periodic%20orbits%20in%20the%20CR3BP.html for numerical methods guidance
- [ ] Before coding, outline the steps required in detail
- [ ] At a minimum, Lyapunov orbit discovery
- [ ] Preferably halo or some type of 3D orbit discovery as well
