# September 9

Recap: I am currently working on understanding how QPOs are generated for my lit review/deepening of understanding of dynamics models. To guide my understanding, I am dissecting the [CR3BP repo](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research) that I previously used to generate training data for my neural ODEs.

Relevant terms to learn and/or implement:
- Shooting methods
	- Single shooting methods
	- Multiple shooting methods
- Differential correction
	- STMs needed for anything involving sensitivities, corrections, or stability
- Continuation methods
- Constraints
- Crossing events

I also need to finalize a research topic for the semester. I am generally interested in looking at n-body dynamics and exploiting the latent nature of neural ODEs. What can we improve using this?

Goals for today:
- [ ]  Study and understand all the terms above at a medium level
- [ ]  Fully understand and implement shooting methods for a simple example
- [ ]  Finalize semester research topic - what are we doing that is novel? How can we exploit the latent nature of neural ODEs? What system will we study? What methods are currently used?
- [ ] Improve understanding of adjoint method - I need to know this in my sleep

## Future plans - neural ODEs for nBP
Latent space representation - a latent space is an embedding of a A latent space, also known as a latent feature space or embedding space, is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of a set of items within a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") in which items resembling each other are positioned closer to one another. Position within the latent space can be viewed as being defined by a set of [latent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable "Latent variable") that emerge from the resemblances from the objects.

In most cases, the [dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality "Dimensionality") of the latent space is chosen to be lower than the dimensionality of the [feature space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_space "Feature space") from which the data points are drawn, making the construction of a latent space an example of [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction "Dimensionality reduction"), which can also be viewed as a form of [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space#cite_note-1)
