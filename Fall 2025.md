# September 9

Recap: I am currently working on understanding how QPOs are generated for my lit review/deepening of understanding of dynamics models. To guide my understanding, I am dissecting the [CR3BP repo](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research) that I previously used to generate training data for my neural ODEs.

Relevant terms to learn and/or implement:
- Shooting methods
	- Single shooting methods
	- Multiple shooting methods
- Differential correction
	- STMs needed for anything involving sensitivities, corrections, or stability
- Continuation methods
- Constraints
- Crossing events

I also need to finalize a research topic for the semester. I am generally interested in looking at n-body dynamics and exploiting the latent nature of neural ODEs. What can we improve using this?

Goals for today:
- [ ]  Study and understand all the terms above at a medium level
- [ ]  Fully understand and implement shooting methods for a simple example
- [ ]  Finalize semester research topic - what are we doing that is novel? How can we exploit the latent nature of neural ODEs? What system will we study? What methods are currently used?
- [ ]
