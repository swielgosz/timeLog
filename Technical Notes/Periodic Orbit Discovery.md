This contains the notes for my literature review regarding periodic orbit discovery. Relevant terms to learn and/or implement:
- Shooting methods
	- Single shooting methods
	- Multiple shooting methods
- Differential correction
	- STMs needed for anything involving sensitivities, corrections, or stability
- Continuation methods
- Constraints/symmetries
- Crossing events
- eigenanalysis
	- what do the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an STM indicate?

Other terms to learn
- Monodromy matrix
- manifolds (local invariant manifolds)
## Shooting methods

## Latent Space
