## Lecture 1 - Introduction
- We can approximate the 4-body system as two 3-body subsystems and patch them together (similar to our classic 2BP patched conics method)
- Topics that are covered:
	- Intro to CR3BP
- Motion near collinear equilibria L1, L2, L3
- Heteroclinic connections and global orbit structure
- Construction of orbits with prescribed itineraries
- Multiple gravity assists and switching orbits
- Trajectories in the four-body problem (patching two three-body trajectories)

## Lecture 2 - 3BP EOM in Inertial Frame
![[Lecture 1 Intro, Equations of Motion, Nondimensionalization.pdf]]

## EOM in Rotating Frame, Lagrangian Equations, Effective Potential Energy
![[Lecture 2 Equations of Motion in Rotating Frame.pdf]]The potential is
$U(x,y,z) = -\frac{(1-\mu)}{r_1}-\frac{mu}{r_2}-\frac{1}{2}\mu(1-\mu)$ 
The last term isn't necessary, it just makes it so that the JC at the triangular Lagrange points ($L_4$, $L_5$) is exactly 3 or a nondimensional energy of exactly -1/2
