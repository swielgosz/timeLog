## Lecture 1 - Introduction
- We can approximate the 4-body system as two 3-body subsystems and patch them together (similar to our classic 2BP patched conics method)
- Topics that are covered:
	- Intro to CR3BP
- Motion near collinear equilibria L1, L2, L3
- Heteroclinic connections and global orbit structure
- Construction of orbits with prescribed itineraries
- Multiple gravity assists and switching orbits
- Trajectories in the four-body problem (patching two three-body trajectories)
