```
- Start a new note every day
- Review / recap where you were previously (in written form)
- Define your goals for the day --- making as many quantifiable as possible
- Propose a rough timeline for completing the activities
- Make a heading for each task, and take detailed notes regarding your progress
- At the end of the day, write a short summary of what you accomplished
