# February
## 2/10 - 2/14
### 2/12
- Integrated Obsidian with git for reliable syncing and backup
- Relocating Zotero papers and improving backup
- Troubleshooting git interactive rebasing `reword` functionality
	- Can't edit commit message:
		1) Change to topic branch
		2) `git rebase -i HEAD~1`
		3) Change `pick` to `reword` for relevant commit
		4) Edit COMMIT_MSG, save and accept commit message 
		5) Error:
			```fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD': is at 7cc8818c8e25dbc3f89c61c6e244f07cb99288bc but expected e296f35c5ab4895eaabd109b197631bbc7067145 Could not apply e296f35... Fixed fps```
- Documenting and practicing git interactive rebasing
- Explored mlds repo

### 2/13
Morning:
- Emails/admin
- Addressing `neuralODE` issues \#1-\#3 and familiarizing myself with necessary concepts such as creating packages for installation, `pyproject.toml`, etc
- Learning more about rebasing for the purpose of continuing development from an unapproved merge request branch

Afternoon:
- Advising meeting
- Read through of "AN UNSUPERVISED PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORK FOR FINDING OPTIMAL LOW-THRUST TRANSFER TRAJECTORIES WITH THE DIRECT METHOD" and related research

### 2/14
Forgot to record - worked on some neuralODE coding stuff, tried to read but wasn't able to focus well - not a very productive day :(

## 2/17-2/21
Must dos for the week:
- [x] Port code over from my FaultDetection repo to MLDS neuralODe repo 
- [ ] Implement CR3BP
- [ ] Implement spherical coordinates
- [ ] NeuralODE trained on multiple orbits (currently just one)
- [ ] Read!! I've been having trouble focusing while reading. Suck a labmate in to listen to my ramblings 
	- [ ] Put together lit review for group meeting
- [ ] Generalize neuralODE training - I want to be able to define runs using a config file

Other things that would be useful:
- [ ] Add classes to code. Looking at toy gitBoarding repo, I've realized there are a few structural changes I should make to my code (functionality is fine for what I've been doing, but I should future proof it more for when code gets more complex).
### 2/17
- Ported code over and reworked packaging structure/relevant related imports
	- This was the main task of the day - sorting through, restructuring, and patching code was time consuming (it was admittedly a refresher for me and required some fix ups. I'm getting heavily back into my code for the first time in a while so). Had some silly packaging issues but they are resolved and everything is working when the correct workspace is set
- Spent some time trying to get plots to show on local machine. I'm having trouble with VcXsrv and whatnot but don't want to waste more time on this until I get my new computer. For the time being, I'm going to save plots as .png files

### 2/18
Goals of the day:
- [x] Spherical coordinates
- [ ] CR3BP
- [ ] NeuralODE trained on multiple orbits
- [x] Work on lit review and finalize paper for Friday

Things I actually did/accomplished:
- Spherical coordinates/review of dynamics
- General code improvements/putting out associated fires/learning more about related git and python stuff 
	- The coding stuff always takes longer than I expect and I should probably be less ambitious for the time being (or be okay with not completing all goals)
- Research direct and indirect OCP
- Advising meetings

### 2/19
Goals of the day:
- [ ] !! Neural ODE trained on multiple orbits
- [ ] Set up new computer :)
- [ ] Work on lit review
- [ ] CR3BP
