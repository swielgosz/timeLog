# February
## 2/10 - 2/14
### 2/12
- Integrated Obsidian with git for reliable syncing and backup
- Relocating Zotero papers and improving backup
- Troubleshooting git interactive rebasing `reword` functionality
	- Can't edit commit message:
		1) Change to topic branch
		2) `git rebase -i HEAD~1`
		3) Change `pick` to `reword` for relevant commit
		4) Edit COMMIT_MSG, save and accept commit message 
		5) Error:
			```fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD': is at 7cc8818c8e25dbc3f89c61c6e244f07cb99288bc but expected e296f35c5ab4895eaabd109b197631bbc7067145 Could not apply e296f35... Fixed fps```
- Documenting and practicing git interactive rebasing
- Explored mlds repo

### 2/13
Morning:
- Emails/admin
- Addressing `neuralODE` issues \#1-\#3 and familiarizing myself with necessary concepts such as creating packages for installation, `pyproject.toml`, etc
- Learning more about rebasing for the purpose of continuing development from an unapproved merge request branch

Afternoon:
- Advising meeting
- Read through of "AN UNSUPERVISED PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORK FOR FINDING OPTIMAL LOW-THRUST TRANSFER TRAJECTORIES WITH THE DIRECT METHOD" and related research

### 2/14
Forgot to record - worked on some neuralODE coding stuff, tried to read but wasn't able to focus well - not a very productive day :(

## 2/17-2/21
Must dos for the week:
- [x] Port code over from my FaultDetection repo to MLDS neuralODe repo 
- [ ] Implement CR3BP
- [x] Implement spherical coordinates
- [ ] NeuralODE trained on multiple orbits (currently just one)
- [x] Read!! I've been having trouble focusing while reading. Suck a labmate in to listen to my ramblings 
	- [x] Put together lit review for group meeting

Other things that would be useful if I have time:
- [ ] Add classes to code. Looking at toy gitBoarding repo, I've realized there are a few structural changes I should make to my code (functionality is fine for what I've been doing, but I should future proof it more for when code gets more complex).
- [ ] Generalize neuralODE training - I want to be able to define runs using a config file
### 2/17
- Ported code over and reworked packaging structure/relevant related imports
	- This was the main task of the day - sorting through, restructuring, and patching code was time consuming (it was admittedly a refresher for me and required some fix ups. I'm getting heavily back into my code for the first time in a while so). Had some silly packaging issues but they are resolved and everything is working when the correct workspace is set
- Spent some time trying to get plots to show on local machine. I'm having trouble with VcXsrv and whatnot but don't want to waste more time on this until I get my new computer. For the time being, I'm going to save plots as .png files

### 2/18
Goals of the day:
- [x] Spherical coordinates
- [ ] CR3BP
- [ ] NeuralODE trained on multiple orbits
- [x] Work on lit review and finalize paper for Friday

Things I actually did/accomplished:
- Spherical coordinates/review of dynamics
- General code improvements/putting out associated fires/learning more about related git and python stuff 
	- The coding stuff always takes longer than I expect and I should probably be less ambitious for the time being (or be okay with not completing all goals)
- Research direct and indirect OCP
- Advising meetings

### 2/19
Goals of the day:
- [ ] !! Neural ODE trained on multiple orbits
- [x] Set up new computer :)
- [x] Work on lit review
- [ ] CR3BP

Things I actually did/accomplished:
- Computer handoff and set up - took about half the day between the pickup and set up
- X-lab group meeting
- OCP research

Reflection of the day:
- Good things that happened:
	- Computer is completely set up to my knowledge! Hopefully won't have any more issues
- Neutral things:
	- So much walking between meetings (brr). Good for health, bad for taking away useful time
- Less good:
	- Didn't get to work on neuralODE code
	- Very tired

Today's rating: 5.5/10

### 2/20
Goals of the day:
- [ ] neural ODE trained on multiple orbits!!!!! Today is the day!!!
	- [ ] doesn't need to be perfect, I just want to get the infrastructure set up
- [x] Finalize lit review presentation and write down talking points
- [x] Get visualization working
- [x] verify that spherical coordinates are working (I previously coded them in but didn't have a chance to check if it was correct)

Things I worked on:
- visualization working
	- update - earlier I (think I) had it working where if I ran code in devcontainer in vscode, plot would appear locally. Now, when I run code from devcontainer,  plots do not appear. It works fine if I run code from curiosity, it's just inconvenient to have vscode open where I'm actually working and a terminal just for running the code for visualization. what did I break?
- Spherical coordinate conversion and 2BP in spherical coordinates not working properly
	- Conversions are incorrect - I was referencing online resources because I didn't want to make silly typos or mistakes in my conversions. Those aren't correct, so I am deriving them by hand
- Put together lit review

Today's rating: 7/10. Not many tangible results, but I was very focused
### 2/21
- Put together lit review talking points
	- Reviewed OCP resources until meeting to guide talking points
	- Post meeting reflection: 
		- I didn't focus much on HJB equation for indirect method, but should review this for my own sake
		- PMP:
			- We understand the equations and *roughly* how they are analogous to physics based Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, etc. But, we should have a more solid understanding of exactly where the controls verison of these equations come from, and what the costate equation is representing (i.e. is it significant that costates and adjoints are interchangeable terms? are these the same or different than lagrange multipliers and how? using lagrange multipliers, we try to minimize energy in a physical system. what is the control analogy of this?)
- MLDS Group meeting

Today's rating: 6.5/10. Group meeting made me realize I knew less than I thought I knew and I was feeling pretty brain foggy by presentation time, but I like lab meetings and people's involvement in lit review discussions. 
## 2/24 - 2/31

Top priorities:
- [ ] Get spherical coordinates (both conversion and 2BP dynamics) working properly
	- [ ] Derive coordinate conversions and dynamics by hand - references have not been reliable
- [ ] Train neural ODEs on multiple orbits
	- I have been waiting for spherical coordinates to be working to try this out, but this keeps delaying me and I should just go ahead and at least set it up with Cartesian and/or orbital elements
- [ ] Get CR3BP working
	- [ ] Add CR3BP dynamics to code
	- [ ] Train neural networks to learn CR3BP

Other things that would be useful if I have time:
- [ ] Add classes to code. Looking at toy gitBoarding repo, I've realized there are a few structural changes I should make to my code (functionality is fine for what I've been doing, but I should future proof it more for when code gets more complex).
- [ ] Generalize neuralODE training - I want to be able to define runs using a config file
- [ ] Review some of the OCP concepts to solidify some muddy points that came up in group meeting

Intentions for the week to be successful!:
 - I keep setting goals ambitiously and then operate slower than necessary to achieve all of them (and/or more fires come up to put out than I would like). No problem - this week I will try setting fewer "must do" goals and a couple stretch goals each day
 - Weather is nice - go for some walks!
 - I'll probably be working from home more this week and over the next month due to very inconveniently placed construction. Make sure to maintain good habits at home (take breaks, eat lunch, wear real pants, etc)
 - Limit news reading to ~20 minutes a day. Want to stay informed but not wallow in an unproductive manner. Similarly, read more novels instead.
 - Set daily to do lists for the next day at the end of the day. Lists are fantastic! Currently, I do this at the beginning of the day but I should use my fresh brain power on more challenging tasks, and make lists at the end of the day when I'm tired.
### 2/24
Realistic goals:
- [ ] Fix spherical coordinates
- [ ] Train neural ODEs on multiple orbits

Things I worked on:
- Went down a rabbit hole refreshing on coordinate frames, conversions, etc. My progression of thoughts:
	- Original plan: 
		1) Derive 2BP in spherical coordinates. Why did I want to derive it in spherical coordinates? 2BP is typically expressed in cartesian coordinates which is analytically convenient, but orbits would be more naturally described in terms of spherical coordinates. I wanted to be able to directly integrate in terms of spherical coordinates, rather than integrating in cartesian and converting to spherical in order to minimize numerical error. Is this necessary/ a good idea? Maybe not
		2) Since we would realistically describe our orbit's initial conditions in terms of spherical coordinates or orbital elements, write conversion script to convert from cartesian to spherical coordinates (I already have Cartesian to orbital elements and vice versa)
	- I was able to derive 2BP dynamics (not yet verified to be correct)
	- Great! Now we need to convert initial conditions to spherical coordinates. It is simple to convert *coordinates*, but we also need *velocities* in spherical components. No worries - consult internet resources/notes from dynamics.
	- Oh no! We have never discussed conversions directly between cartesian and spherical velocities. Rather, we begin with $\vec{r} = r\hat{e}_r$ and differentiate from there to get velocity and acceleration in spherical coordinates
	- That's okay. I'll refresh on my dynamics and try to search around/derive this myself
	- There's a suspicious lack of information on this... maybe that's for a reason. Some of the online discussions that basically identified my confusions:
		- https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/763908/direct-conversion-of-cartesian-velocity-to-spherical-velocity-and-vice-versa
		- https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/546479/conversion-of-cartesian-position-and-velocity-to-spherical-velocity
