The topic of the conference paper in the spring will most likely be forcing linearization in latent space and extending this to find periodic orbits and the offshooting trajectories. 
We need to heavily extend the results of the conference paper. This will include:
- [ ] sensitivity studies
- [ ] 3D orbits
	- [ ] extend 2BP to 3D
	- [ ] extend CR3BP to more than just Lyapunov orbits

## Datasets
Our TBP planar was named `<complex|simple>_TBP_planar_<num_orbits>_<train|test>`
Let's follow the same convention for nonplanar

## Sensitivities to study
- Effect of amount of training data
- Effect of segmentation strategy
-
