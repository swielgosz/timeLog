# January
Hurray, a new year of research! First goal (and deadline) of the year is to put out a journal paper by start of Spring semester.

# January 7
Today, I need to develop an initial narrative for my journal paper and determine what is left to be done. I'm not totally sure what story I am trying to tell, because I haven't gotten to the portion of the research focusing on forced linearization of latent ODEs to find trajectories in cislunar space. It looks like the paper will focus on extending the results of the conference paper but I'm not sure if the "story" itself will develop?

 Working at my parents' house was very difficult, so I need to buckle down extra hard the next few weeks.
